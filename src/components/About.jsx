                    <p>
                        I'm a dynamic Frontend Developer with 3+ years of experience crafting high-performance web applications using React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript. Based in London, UK, I specialize in building scalable, responsive, and exceptionally functional websites, applications, and everything in between.                </p>
                    <p>
                        As a skilled web developer with experience in UI design, I have a strong understanding of web development best practices and semantic standards. My expertise includes working with modern frameworks along with traditional technologies, and I have a good understanding of SEO. My strong React and Agile skills enable me to design better user experiences.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having demonstrated success across startup and agency environments, I bring genuine passion for solving complex technical challenges through clean, efficient code. I'm seeking a long-term opportunity with a forward-thinking team where I can grow professionally while delivering exceptional solutions in a collaborative corporate environment.
